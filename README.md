# Command Pattern Study
[Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern) is a programming pattern. Defined by the [Gang of Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_of_Four_(software)) as a pattern which is purposed to:
>Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting users parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

This project has implemented the pattern to handle game actors as explained in [Bob Nystrom](https://twitter.com/munificentbob)'s book [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/command.html).
